PCC Student Mobile App
Welcome!

This repository contains the code for the Pasadena City College (PCC) Student Mobile App that I helped develop. The app is designed to support the PCC student 
community by providing easy access to essential tools and resources for their daily academic activities.

Purpose:
The primary goal of this app is to streamline student operations and help students stay organized. 
Key features include:
- Access to Student Email: Quick access to official student email.
- Canvas Integration: View course content, announcements, and grades.
- Daily Schedule Overview: See your upcoming classes and events.
- Assignment Tracker: Keep track of due dates and submission statuses.
